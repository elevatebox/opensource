                                                                        I have enquired about these companies heben striet company which is in germany and franz haas company  which is now handled by Bulher company whis in india,bangalore branch the marketing manager of bulher company is Mr.vikrant sawant and his Phone No:7338481314 its better to contact him  and know about the wafer line and resolve the issuse it will give the good result and they will take care over the whole wafer biscuit line machine.without the company support we can't  do anything.
                                                                                                                    Thanking you,
